# 2.10.13.  Signature Algorithm
#
# This field is OPTIONAL.
# 
# The signature algorithm defines what algorithm to use for signature
# generation and verification.
# 
# If the algorithm suite includes a signature algorithm:
# 
# *  Signatures MUST be generated using the specified signature
#    algorithm.
# 
# *  Signatures MUST be verified using the specified signature
#    algorithm.
# 
# If the algorithm suite does not include a signature algorithm:
# 
# *  Signatures MUST NOT be generated.
# 
# *  Signatures MUST NOT be verified.
