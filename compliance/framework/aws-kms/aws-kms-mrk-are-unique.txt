1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here

2.3.  Overview

   Duplicate multi-region key ids create ambiguity about which Region to
   contact.  This is better resolved outside of the AWS Encryption SDK.
   While preferring the "local" Region is a seductive solution, this can
   not be 100% correct.  First, because not all code runs in an AWS
   Region, and second because customers may want create privacy controls
   around their data.  In this case nearby region may exists and store
   ciphertext, but may be restricted from having the AWS KMS keys.  In
   any complicated deployment determining the closest, or preferred
   region is itself a complicated task.  It will be easier for customers
   to reason about this criteria and ensure their code is correct if the
   AWS Encryption SDK offers one and only one configuration for a
   behavior. e.g.  If the preferred region logic results in an ambiguous
   configuration is informed and they can resolve the ambiguity.  Rather
   than attempting to resolve it ourselves.

   Preferring the local region does not suffice: not all code runs in an
   AWS Region boundary, and customers need to assert intentions to use a
   region.

2.4.  Definitions

2.4.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

2.5.  Implementation

   The caller MUST provide:

   *  A list of AWS KMS key identifiers

   If the list does not contain any multi-Region keys (aws-kms-key-
   arn.md#identifying-an-aws-kms-multi-region-key) this function MUST
   exit successfully.

   If there are zero duplicate resource ids between the multi-region
   keys, this function MUST exit successfully

   If any duplicate multi-region resource ids exist, this function MUST
   yield an error that includes all identifiers with duplicate resource
   ids not only the first duplicate found.
