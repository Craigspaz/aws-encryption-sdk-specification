1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here

2.  AWS KMS MRK Match for Decrypt

2.1.1.  Changelog

   *  0.2.2

      -  Initial record

2.2.  Implementations

   | Language | Confirmed Compatible with Spec Version | Minimum Version

2.3.  Overview

   Since the AWS Encryption SDK stores the AWS KMS key ARN in the
   encrypted data key of the message format an AWS KMS component needs
   to be able to evaluate if a configured ARN matches a stored ARN.
   This is especially important for multi-Region keys because the match
   does not need to be exact.

2.4.  Definitions

2.4.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

2.5.  Implementation

   The caller MUST provide:

   *  2 AWS KMS key identifiers

   If both identifiers are identical, this function MUST return "true".
   Otherwise if either input is not identified as a multi-Region key
   (aws-kms-key-arn.md#identifying-an-aws-kms-multi-region-key), then
   this function MUST return "false".  Otherwise if both inputs are
   identified as a multi-Region keys (aws-kms-key-arn.md#identifying-an-
   aws-kms-multi-region-key), this function MUST return the result of
   comparing the "partition", "service", "accountId", "resourceType",
   and "resource" parts of both ARN inputs.  NOTE: The "region" part is
   intentionally omitted.
